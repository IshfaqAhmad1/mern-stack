Q2. Difference between Scalar graphics and Vector graphics.
Scalar graphics and vector graphics are two different types of digital graphic representations that store and display images in distinct ways:
1.	Raster or Scalar Graphics:
•	Definition: Scalar or raster graphics are composed of a grid of pixels, each pixel containing a specific color value. Common raster image formats include JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.
•	Resolution-dependent: Raster images have a fixed resolution defined by the number of pixels. Enlarging a raster image can lead to a loss of quality or pixelation since adding more pixels means stretching the existing ones.
•	Examples: Photographs taken with digital cameras, scanned images, and most images found on the web are raster graphics.
•	Editing: Raster images can be edited using software like Adobe Photoshop, but scaling them up may result in a loss of quality.
2.	Vector Graphics:
•	Definition: Vector graphics are composed of paths or shapes defined by mathematical equations. They use points, lines, curves, and shapes to represent images, which allows them to be scaled infinitely without losing quality.
•	Resolution-independent: Vector graphics are resolution-independent since they are based on mathematical calculations. They can be scaled up or down without losing quality.
•	Examples: Logos, icons, illustrations, and designs created using tools like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW are typically vector graphics.
•	Editing: Vector images are easily editable. You can manipulate individual elements like lines, curves, and shapes without losing quality.
Key Differences:
•	Scaling: Vector graphics can be scaled infinitely without losing quality, while raster images lose quality when scaled up.
•	File Size: Raster images can have larger file sizes, especially at higher resolutions, whereas vector graphics tend to have smaller file sizes.
•	Editing: Vector graphics are easier to edit, allowing manipulation of individual elements, while raster graphics can be harder to edit without affecting quality.
•	Usage: Raster images are used for photographs and images with complex color gradients, while vector graphics are preferred for logos, icons, and illustrations that require scalability.
Both types have their strengths and are used in various contexts depending on the requirements of the project.

5. Web Compatibility: SVGs are supported by all major modern browsers, making them a popular choice for web-based graphics and icons.
SVGs are commonly used for icons, logos, illustrations, charts, maps, and other graphic elements on websites and in various applications. They offer a flexible and versatile way to display high-quality graphics across different devices and screen sizes.

Q6. What is VML?
VML stands for Vector Markup Language. It was an XML-based file format used to create vector graphics on the web. VML was primarily developed by Microsoft and intended to provide a way to describe vector-based 2D graphics for web pages, similar to what SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) achieves.
VML was mainly supported by Internet Explorer and was used for creating simple shapes, lines, and basic drawings directly within web pages. It was introduced as a part of Internet Explorer 5.0 and was intended to be a competitor to SVG.
However, with the development and adoption of more modern web standards like HTML5 and the widespread support of SVG across multiple browsers, VML became obsolete. Major browsers stopped supporting VML, and Microsoft shifted its focus to supporting SVG, leading to the decline of VML usage.
As of now, SVG has largely replaced VML as the standard for vector graphics on the web due to its widespread support, better features, and broader compatibility across different browsers and devices.
